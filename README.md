### Funding
The content for this textbook was funded by the European Commission’s Erasmus+ via a scheme called ‘Computing Competences – Innovative learning approach for non-IT students’ (CCI) – a project which University of Bedfordshire collaborated on. 

I worked at University of Bedfordshire as a research consultant to develop these materials under the guidance of Prof. Yanqing Duan.
