**TL:DR** - *This is a short, interactive textbook aimed at introducing data science to non-IT university undergraduates.*

### Textbook Structure
The textbook has 7 lessons with the following structure:
 1. Introductory Lesson
 2. Applied lessons:
     * Input and Output
     * Manipulation of Data
     * Graphs
     * Descriptive Statistics
     * Linear Regression and Correlation

Each lesson has a set of 5 questions which should be answered and self-marked. 

### Funding
The content for this textbook was funded by the European Commission’s Erasmus+ via a scheme called ‘Computing Competences – Innovative learning approach for non-IT students’ (CCI) – a project which University of Bedfordshire collaborated on. 

I worked at University of Bedfordshire as a research consultant to develop these materials under the guidance of Prof. Yanqing Duan.
